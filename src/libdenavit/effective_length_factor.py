    """Calculate the effective length factor K.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sidesway : {'inhibited', 'uninhibited'}
        Whether sidesway is inhibited (e.g., braced frames) or uninhibited
        (e.g., moment frames).
    GA, GB : float
        Ratio of column flexural stiffness to girder flexural stiffness at
        ends A and B of the member, respectively. (See AISC Specification
        equation C-A-7-3.)

    Notes
    -----
    K is calculated using the AISC nomogram equations, which rely on the
    following assumptions (quoting the AISC commentary):

    1. Behavior is purely elastic.
    2. All members have constant cross section.
    3. All joints are rigid.
    4. For columns in frames with sidesway inhibited, rotations at opposite
       ends of the restraining beams are equal in magnitude and opposite in
       direction, producing single curvature bending.
    5. For columns in frames with sidesway uninhibited, rotations at opposite
       ends of the restraining beams are equal in magnitude and direction,
       producing reverse curvature bending.
    6. The stiffness parameter Lâˆš(P/EI) of all columns is equal.
    7. Joint restraint is distributed to the column above and below the joint
       in proportion to EI/L for the two columns.
    8. All columns buckle simultaneously.
    9. No significant axial compression force exists in the girders.
    10. Shear deformations are neglected.
